# Sudoku Solver in C
The following is a randomly generated sudoku puzzle generator as well as a solver.

If one wishes to solve a sudoku puzzle of their own and not have it randomly generated, simply comment out the first if statement
in the main() and "Generate_Puzzle(board)".

If one wishes to use a randomly generated board, the MACRO, NUM_NONEMPTY_CELLS can be changed to the number of
non empty cells(non-zero cells) one wishes the board to initially starts off with. 

The word "cell" in the code refers a specific row and col on the board.
